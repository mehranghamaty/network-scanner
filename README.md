# Network Tool

Would like a gui application to monitor network traffer for each process id.

# TODO

The way that psysimple works would like a widget for 

1. graphs
    a. Should have a legend
    b. display 2 lines

Okay seems like the app is somewhat okay. 

Here's a screengrab of the list of processes; which works on Windows and Linux

![Process List](Images/examplelist.png)

When selecting a process from the list a graph launches providing information regarding the process. 
This only works on Linux at the moment. Also single threaded which should be updated.

Should find a proper structure

# Running

python main.py
